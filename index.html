        <h1>PROJECT: BUDDY (BETA)</h1>

        <h3>
            Welcome and thank you for signing up as a BETA tester of PROJECT BUDDY, a brand new therapy simulation experience created by Pygmalion & Co., the world's leading organisation on mental health.
        </h3>
      
        <h3>
            With the youth of today finding it harder than ever to relate and open up to others, it is our duty to give them a friend they can talk to, so that they may grow up into wonderful, successful (not emotionally stunted or compromised) young adults.
        </h3>
      
        <h3>
            Your job will be to interact with one of our many newly developed 'BUDDIES'! As they are a brand new technology (not even announced to the major publications and media yet), please take note of the responses your BUDDY gives and how they make you feel, and make sure to report any bugs you find along the way!
            Are you ready?
        </h3>

        <h5>
            *Please note that due to budget cuts the fluid conversation model has been discontinued for PROJECT: BUDDY (BETA). Currently only the selective conversation model is available.

If any information of PROJECT BUDDY is found to have been released to the public without express permission from Pygmalion & Co. you WILL be heavily penalised.
